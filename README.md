# Slime Volleyball

This is a project to explore both making games and using other computers as controllers via web sockets. The idea is to make a slime volleyball clone.

Why slime volleyball?
Because the game has simple rules and focuses on the movements of two characters to be controlled by two players. It is an opportunity to test multi touch capabilities combined with communicating via web sockets.
